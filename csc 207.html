			THE LAW OF MOTION

    John and James were neighbours and envy of each other. One day, John while taking a walk on his terrace saw smoke all around him. He looked down and saw that James was burning some leaves. He asked him not to do so.

At this, James replied, "What can I do in this? Smoke always goes up." Then John brought a bucket full of water and poured it over the burning leaves. 

When James shouted at him, he said, "What can I do in this? Water always flows down."

James had no answer to this.

The End..

			THE VALUABLE GIFT

   John had a desire to have a bicycle of his own but his father was not rich enough to afford the same. 

One day, when John was on his way to school, he saw a big boy on a cycle. As the boy was turning around a corner, the cycle skidded on a puddle of water and the boy fell down. 

John went to him and helped him to get up. The boy was badly injured. John first took him to a doctor and then helped him to reach his house.

The boy belonged to a rich family and gladly presented the cycle to John.

The End..

				WHO WILL EAT THE HAY ?

   One day a camel, a goat and an ass were walking down the road when they saw a bundle of hay lying road-side. But it was not sufficient for all three of them. 

The ass said, "This hay is not enough for all three of us. Let the oldest among us eat it." The goat and the camel agreed. But they started arguing about who was older among them. Suddenly, the camel started eating the hay. 

The goat shouted, "What are you doing?"

At this the camel replied, "You just said that the oldest may eat it. Look at my knobby joints and wrinkled skin. So, I am the oldest."

Saying this, the camel went ahead and ate the hay.

The End..
